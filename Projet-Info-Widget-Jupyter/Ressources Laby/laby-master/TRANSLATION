Location:

  Translation data is stored in the file "data/texts".

  Its format is human-friendly, it consists of a bunch of entries of
  this kind:

    text            option <opt> requires an argument
    en_US.UTF-8     option <opt> requires an argument
    fr_FR.UTF-8     l'option <opt> nécessite un argument

  The first line gives the text as written in the program source code,
  following lines are translations of this text in various locales.

  You may use a modified version of this file, laby will look for it
  at the following locations (in this order):
    ~/.config/laby/texts
    /usr/share/laby/texts

  Levels stored in data/levels also contain translatable strings
  using the same format.

Contributions:

  If you wish to contribute new translations or improve existing ones,
  you are welcome to send them by email to:
